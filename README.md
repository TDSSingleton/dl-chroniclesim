An exploration of GDShader formats that generates image effects relatively close to Duel Links' Chronicle effects.

## Required files

Certain ttf files are required to properly compile the program as is seen here. Their access is a bit dubious so they have no been included in the repo. You should need only one. The sim does not include card text on purpose.
